    "So far, we have discussed a class of deep generative models that model the distribution $p(\\mathbf{x})$ directly in an autoregressive manner. The main advantage of ARMs is that they can learn long-range statistics and, in a consequence, powerful density estimators. However, their drawback is that they are parameterized in an autoregressive manner, hence, sampling is rather a slow process. Moreover, they lack a latent representation, therefore, it's not obvious how to manipulate their internal data representation that makes it less appealing for tasks like lossy compression or metric learning.\n",

    "Yes and no. Yes in the sense it is the minimalistic example of an implementation of the RealNVP. No, because there are many **improvements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Factoring out_ (Dinh et al., 2016): During the forward pass (from $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\mathbf{z}$), we can split the variables and proceed with processing only a subset of them. This could help to parameterize the base distribution by using the outputs of intermediate layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Rezero trick_ (Bachlechner et al., 2020): Introducing additional parameters to the coupling layer, e.g., $\\mathbf{y}_{b} = \\exp\\left(\\alpha s(\\mathbf{x}_{a})\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{x}_{b} + \\beta t(\\mathbf{x}_{a})$ and $\\alpha, \\beta$ are initilized with $0$'s. This helps to ensure that the transformations act as identity maps in the beginning. It is shown in (Bachlechner et al., 2020) that it helps to learn better transformations by maintaining information about the input through all layers in the beginning of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Masking_ or _Checkerboard pattern_ (Dinh et al., 2016): We can use a checkerboard pattern instead of dividing an input into two parts like $[\\mathbf{x}_{1:D/2}, \\mathbf{x}_{D/2+1:D}]$. This encourages learning local statistics better.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Squeezing_ (Dinh et al., 2016): We can also play around with \"squeezing\" some dimensions. For instance, an image consists of _C_ channels, width _W_, and height _H_, could be turned into _4C_ channels, width _W/2_ and height _H/2_.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Learnable base distributions_ : instead of using a standard Gaussian base distribution, we can use another model for that, e.g., an autoregressive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Invertible 1x1 convolution_ (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018): A fixed permutation could be replaced with a (learned) invertible 1x1 convolution as in the GLOW model of Kingma & Dhariwal.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Variational dequantization_ (Ho et al., 2019a): We can also pick a different dequantization scheme, e.g., variational dequantization. This allows to obtain much better scored. However, it's not for free because it leads to a lower bound to the log-likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there are many **new fascinating research directions**! I will name them here and point to papers where you can find more details:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Compression with flows_ (Ho et al., 2019b): Flow-based models are perfect candidates for compression since they allow to calculate the exact likelihood. Ho et al. proposed a scheme that allows to use flows in the bit-back-like compression scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Conditional flows_ (Stypulkowski et al., 2020, Winkler et al., 2019; Wolf et al., 2021): Here, we present the unconditional RealNVP. However, we can used a flow-based model for conditional distributions. For instance, we can use the conditioning as an input to the scale network and the translation network.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Variational inference with flows_ (van den Berg et al., 2018; Kingma et al., 2016; Rezende & Mohamed, 2015; Hoogeboom et al., 2021; Tomczak & Welling, 2016; Tomczak & Welling, 2017): Conditional flow-based models could be used to form a flexible family of variational posteriors. The, the lower-bound to the log-likelihood function should be tighter.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Integer discrete flows_ (Hoogeboom et al., 2019; van den Berg et al., 2020; Tomczak, 2020): Another interesting direction is a version of the RealNVP for integer-valued data. We will explain it in another blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Flows on manifolds_ (Brehmer & Cranmer, 2020): Typically, flow-based models are considered in the Euclidean space. However, they could be considered in non-Euclidean spaces, resulting in new properties of (partially) invertible transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other interesting information on flow-based models could be found in a fantastic review by (Papamakarios et al., 2019)."
